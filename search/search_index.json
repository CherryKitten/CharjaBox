Do not change files in this folder, as it is tracked by git. To do this, create variable files (or folders) in either group_vars/ or host_vars . These can either be files called $GROUPNAME.yml / $HOSTNAME.yml or folders called $GROUPNAME / $HOSTNAME with any number of .yml files inside. Then, overwrite variables in the form of $VARIABLE: $VALUE . If you use CharjaBox to set up multiple servers, you can use different settings for every server, by having multiple groups and/or hosts with different variables in your inventory. General charjabox_general.yml includes all general configuration about your server, like Hostnames, Timezones, etc. charjabox_ports.yml includes all the ports for the applications in one place. Application Settings Every application has it's own variables, where you can enable the Application and apply App-specific configuration. Example I have a local server currently running Portainer, Heimdall, Nginx and Plex. I called the group production to differentiate it from a testing server. The inventory file looks like this: [production] 192.168.1.22 [testing] 192.168.1.33 [someothergroup] 192.168.1.42 The group name production tells Ansible to look for the file group_vars/production.yml or the folder group_vars/production , which looks like this: charjabox_hostname: \"charjabox_production\" charjabox_domain: \"charjabox.production\" portainer_enabled: true nginx_enabled: true nginx_http_port: 10080 nginx_https_port: 10443 firefly_enabled: true firefly_db_password: \"[REDACTED]\" firefly_app_key: \"[REDACTED]\"","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"configuration/#configuration","text":"Configuration is done by overwriting the defaults that are set in group_vars/all/* .
