By default the directory settings/charjabox/ is used if you don't specify a different path. You should never touch the settings/defaults/ folder in normal use. You only need to add the settings that you actually change to your settings folder. If you do this by copying the whole files over from settings/defaults/ or by creating your own files with just the variables you need is up to you. Every file ending in .yml inside of settings/$YOURSETTINGS will be recognized by CharjaBox. If you use CharjaBox to set up multiple servers, you can use different settings folders for every server. To do this, set different hostnames or groups for your different servers in your Inventory and create host_vars/$HOSTNAME or group_vars/$GROUPNAME files for each server/group. In those files you can change the charjabox_settings_path variable and set your settings in a folder inside of settings/ with the same name as the variable. General charjabox_general.yml includes all general configuration about your server, like Hostnames, Timezones, etc. charjabox_ports.yml includes all the ports for the applications in one place. Application Settings Every application has it's own settings file, where you can enable the Application and apply App-specific configuration. Example I have a local server currently running Portainer, Heimdall, Nginx and Plex. I called the group production to differentiate it from a testing server. The inventory file looks like this: [production] 192.168.1.22 [testing] 192.168.1.33 [someothergroup] 192.168.1.42 The group name production tells Ansible to look for the file group_vars/production.yml , which looks like this: charjabox_settings_path: \"production\" This variable tells the playbook to look for custom variables in settings/production , where I have the following files containing custom settings: charjabox_general.yml heimdall.yml nginx.yml plex.yml portainer.yml","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"configuration/#configuration","text":"Configuration is done in multiple files in a group-specific subfolder of the settings folder.

If you run your own DNS server, you can get all the domains for the supported CDNs from here . Redirect those to your CharjaBox IP (and set up a reverse proxy for those domains if not using port 80). A simple example setup using BIND and Nginx with the Cache running on 192.168.1.22 on port 6666 could look like this: BIND db.rpz: TTL 60 @ IN SOA localhost. root.localhost. ( 2015112501 ; serial 1h ; refresh 30m ; retry 1w ; expiry 30m) ; minimum IN NS localhost. localhost A 127.0.0.1 *.content.steampowered.com A 192.168.1.22 content1.steampowered.com A 192.168.1.22 content2.steampowered.com A 192.168.1.22 content3.steampowered.com A 192.168.1.22 content4.steampowered.com A 192.168.1.22 content5.steampowered.com A 192.168.1.22 content6.steampowered.com A 192.168.1.22 content7.steampowered.com A 192.168.1.22 content8.steampowered.com A 192.168.1.22 cs.steampowered.com A 192.168.1.22 steamcontent.com A 192.168.1.22 client-download.steampowered.com A 192.168.1.22 *.hsar.steampowered.com.edgesuite.net A 192.168.1.22 *.akamai.steamstatic.com A 192.168.1.22 content-origin.steampowered.com A 192.168.1.22 clientconfig.akamai.steamtransparent.com A 192.168.1.22 steampipe.akamaized.net A 192.168.1.22 edgecast.steamstatic.com A 192.168.1.22 steam.apac.qtlglb.com.mwcloudcdn.com A 192.168.1.22 *.cs.steampowered.com A 192.168.1.22 *.cm.steampowered.com A 192.168.1.22 *.edgecast.steamstatic.com A 192.168.1.22 *.steamcontent.com A 192.168.1.22 cdn1-sea1.valve.net A 192.168.1.22 cdn2-sea1.valve.net A 192.168.1.22 *.steam-content-dnld-1.apac-1-cdn.cqloud.com A 192.168.1.22 *.steam-content-dnld-1.eu-c1-cdn.cqloud.com A 192.168.1.22 steam.apac.qtlglb.com A 192.168.1.22 edge.steam-dns.top.comcast.net A 192.168.1.22 edge.steam-dns-2.top.comcast.net A 192.168.1.22 steam.naeu.qtlglb.com A 192.168.1.22 steampipe-kr.akamaized.net A 192.168.1.22 steam.ix.asn.au A 192.168.1.22 steam.eca.qtlglb.com A 192.168.1.22 steam.cdn.on.net A 192.168.1.22 update5.dota2.wmsj.cn A 192.168.1.22 update2.dota2.wmsj.cn A 192.168.1.22 update6.dota2.wmsj.cn A 192.168.1.22 update3.dota2.wmsj.cn A 192.168.1.22 update1.dota2.wmsj.cn A 192.168.1.22 update4.dota2.wmsj.cn A 192.168.1.22 update5.csgo.wmsj.cn A 192.168.1.22 update2.csgo.wmsj.cn A 192.168.1.22 update4.csgo.wmsj.cn A 192.168.1.22 update3.csgo.wmsj.cn A 192.168.1.22 update6.csgo.wmsj.cn A 192.168.1.22 update1.csgo.wmsj.cn A 192.168.1.22 st.dl.bscstorage.net A 192.168.1.22 cdn.mileweb.cs.steampowered.com.8686c.com A 192.168.1.22 Nginx site config: server { listen 80; listen 443; server_name *.content.steampowered.com content1.steampowered.com content2.steampowered.com content3.steampowered.com content4.steampowered.com content5.steampowered.com content6.steampowered.com content7.steampowered.com content8.steampowered.com cs.steampowered.com steamcontent.com client-download.steampowered.com *.hsar.steampowered.com.edgesuite.net *.akamai.steamstatic.com content-origin.steampowered.com clientconfig.akamai.steamtransparent.com steampipe.akamaized.net edgecast.steamstatic.com steam.apac.qtlglb.com.mwcloudcdn.com *.cs.steampowered.com *.cm.steampowered.com *.edgecast.steamstatic.com *.steamcontent.com cdn1-sea1.valve.net cdn2-sea1.valve.net *.steam-content-dnld-1.apac-1-cdn.cqloud.com *.steam-content-dnld-1.eu-c1-cdn.cqloud.com steam.apac.qtlglb.com edge.steam-dns.top.comcast.net edge.steam-dns-2.top.comcast.net steam.naeu.qtlglb.com steampipe-kr.akamaized.net steam.ix.asn.au steam.eca.qtlglb.com steam.cdn.on.net update5.dota2.wmsj.cn update2.dota2.wmsj.cn update6.dota2.wmsj.cn update3.dota2.wmsj.cn update1.dota2.wmsj.cn update4.dota2.wmsj.cn update5.csgo.wmsj.cn update2.csgo.wmsj.cn update4.csgo.wmsj.cn update3.csgo.wmsj.cn update6.csgo.wmsj.cn update1.csgo.wmsj.cn st.dl.bscstorage.net cdn.mileweb.cs.steampowered.com.8686c.com; location / { include proxy_params; proxy_pass http://192.168.1.22:6666; } }","title":"Lancache"},{"location":"applications/lidarr/","text":"Lidarr Lidarr - Manage your music collection Set lidarr_data_directory to the folder where downloaded .torrent files should get stored.
